I have $3000, and I want to buy a 4x4 Truck, that will cost somewhere around $8000 - $9000, as well as additional accessories that will cost another $1500. 
I am a software developer with 20 years experience and am unemployed. I don't pay rent at the moment and have only about $150 in bills a month.
Help come up with a plan to get the truck and accessories for the least amount of money. I'm located in Idaho, CA.
